## Hi 👋! 

I'm Samuel,

I'm an experienced software developer 🤖 

I'm mainly working with Elixir ⚗️ both professionaly and in my free time! It's a exciting language, with lots of tools and great features to build powerful web services.

If you are interested, I wrote an article : 

[<h3>Elixir: How to distribute Mnesia between multiple nodes</h3><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16072194/123508664-05176580-d671-11eb-9f21-5ff2588d3ad7.png" width="500">](https://bit.ly/3qukqDc)


I'm also curious about 3D and Game Development, I spend some time playing around with Unity or trying to build some small stuff with C++.

🌴 I'm currently working @ *[Welcome To The Jungle](https://bit.ly/3w04qd9)* in 🇫🇷, We are building great products using Elixir!
