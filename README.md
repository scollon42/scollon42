## Hi 👋! 

I'm Samuel,

I'm an experienced software developer 🤖 

I'm mainly working with Elixir ⚗️ both professionaly and in my free time! It's a exciting language, with lots of tools and great features to build powerful web services.


I'm also curious about 3D and Game Development, I spend some time playing around with Unity or trying to build some small stuff with C++.

🌴 I'm currently working @ *[Welcome To The Jungle](https://bit.ly/3w04qd9)* in 🇫🇷, We are building great products using Elixir! 

We are actively hiring for different positions in France (full remote or in Paris)! 🎉 :
